# C-WinForms-DataGridView-Custom-NumericUpDown
This is the required classes/code for a custom NumericUpDown control that has leading/trailing symbols in it's textbox (e.g. "$", "%", "Dollars", etc.) embedded in a Windows DataGridView (column & cells).

The code for the DataGridViewNumericUpDownCell, DataGridViewNumericUpDownColumn, and DataGridViewNumericUpDownEditingControl were originally gathered from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/aa730881(v=vs.80)?redirectedfrom=MSDN), but modified to work with the CustomNumericUpDown and its properties.

The code for the CustomNumericUpDown originally came from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38558866/19257264). 

In this repo, these two examples have been merged together and work well
